The first step into mastering these is selecting the proper tools!!

As every carpenter need's their hammer, every developer need's their IDE!! (Integrated Development Environment). 

## What is an IDE?

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program.

IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.

## Time to configure your machine

### The Coder's Creed

> This is my laptop. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

>My laptop is my best friend. It is my profession. I must master it as I must master my profession.

>Without me, my laptop is useless. Without my laptop, my code is useless. I must code on my laptop true. I must write code well, so that I can secure the bag!


Understanding what is installed on your machine, is paramount! You are no longer waiting for IT to install things, you are NOW IT!.
